## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-23

This version marks a significant redesign and the first major public release, establishing the core architecture and feature set based on the principles outlined in the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

### üöÄ Highlights

* **Async-Native Core:** Introduced first-class `async`/`await` support across component resolution (`container.aget`), initialization (`__ainit__`), lifecycle hooks (`@configure`, `@cleanup`), AOP interceptors, and the event bus (ADR-001).
* **Tree-Based Configuration:** Added `@configured` decorator and `TreeSource` protocol for binding complex, nested configuration (YAML/JSON) to dataclass graphs, including interpolation and type coercion (ADR-002).
* **Context-Aware Scopes:** Implemented `contextvars`-based scopes (e.g., `"request"`, `"session"`) for managing component lifecycles tied to specific contexts (ADR-003).
* **Observability Features:** Integrated container context (`container_id`, `as_current`), basic stats (`container.stats()`), observer protocol (`ContainerObserver`), and dependency graph export (`container.export_graph()`) (ADR-004).
* **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Implemented method interception via `MethodInterceptor` protocol and `@intercepted_by` decorator, using a dynamic proxy (`UnifiedComponentProxy`) (ADR-005).
* **Eager Startup Validation:** Added fail-fast validation during `init()` to detect missing dependencies and configuration errors before runtime (ADR-006).
* **Built-in Event Bus:** Included an asynchronous, in-process event bus (`EventBus`, `@subscribe`, `AutoSubscriberMixin`) for decoupled communication (ADR-007).
* **Explicit Circular Dependency Handling:** Implemented detection and fail-fast for circular dependencies, requiring explicit resolution patterns (ADR-008).
* **Unified Decorator API:** Consolidated component metadata into parameterized decorators (`@component`, `@factory`, `@provides`), removing older stacked decorators (ADR-009).

### ‚ú® Added

* Core registration decorators: `@component`, `@factory`, `@provides`.
* Configuration decorators: `@configuration` (flat key-value) and `@configured` (tree-based).
* Lifecycle decorators: `@configure`, `@cleanup`.
* AOP decorator: `@intercepted_by`.
* Event bus decorator: `@subscribe`.
* Health check decorator: `@health`.
* Async resolution: `container.aget()` and `__ainit__` convention.
* Async cleanup: `container.cleanup_all_async()`.
* Qualifier support (`Qualifier` class) for list injection (`Annotated[List[Type], Qualifier(...)]`).
* Support for `lazy=True` parameter for deferred component instantiation.
* Conditional binding parameters (`conditional_profiles`, `conditional_require_env`, `conditional_predicate`).
* Fallback binding parameters (`on_missing_selector`, `on_missing_priority`).
* Primary selection parameter (`primary=True`).
* Testing support via `init(overrides={...})` and `init(profiles=(...))`.
* Container context management (`as_current`, `get_current`, `shutdown`, `all_containers`).
* Scope management API (`activate_scope`, `deactivate_scope`, `scope` context manager).
* Configuration sources: `EnvSource`, `FileSource` (flat); `JsonTreeSource`, `YamlTreeSource`, `DictSource` (tree).
* Protocols for extension: `MethodInterceptor`, `ContainerObserver`, `ScopeProtocol`, `ConfigSource`, `TreeSource`.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

* Complete redesign compared to any prior internal/unreleased versions. APIs are not backward compatible.
* Requires Python 3.10+.

### üìö Docs

* Established new documentation structure including ADRs, Architecture, User Guide, Advanced Features, Cookbook, Integrations, and API Reference.

### üß™ Testing

* Added comprehensive test suite covering core features, async behavior, AOP, configuration, scopes, and error handling.
* Introduced patterns for testing with overrides and profiles.

## [<2.0.0]

* Internal development and prototyping phase. Basic dependency injection concepts established. Architecture significantly reworked for the v2.0.0 release.
