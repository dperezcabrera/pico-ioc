## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added ‚ú®

* **Unified Configuration Builder (`configuration(...)`)**: Introduced a new top-level function `configuration(...)` that accepts various sources (`EnvSource`, `DictSource`, `JsonTreeSource`, `YamlTreeSource`, `FlatDictSource`, etc.) and `overrides` to produce an immutable `ContextConfig` object. This centralizes configuration definition and precedence rules (ADR-010).
* **`ContextConfig` Object**: A new object encapsulating the fully processed configuration state, passed to `init(config=...)`.
* **Enhanced `@configured` Decorator**:
    * Added `mapping: Literal["auto", "flat", "tree"]` parameter to explicitly control binding strategy.
    * Implemented `"auto"` detection: uses `"tree"` if any field is complex (dataclass, list, dict, Union), otherwise uses `"flat"`.
    * Supports unified normalization rules for keys (e.g., `ENV_VAR_NAME` <-> `field_name`, `ENV_VAR__NESTED` <-> `parent.nested`).
    * Integrates seamlessly with both flat and tree sources managed by `ContextConfig`.

### Changed ‚ö†Ô∏è

* **`init()` Signature**: The `config` and `tree_config` parameters have been removed. Configuration is now passed solely through the new `config: Optional[ContextConfig]` parameter (ADR-010).
* **Configuration Precedence**: Configuration loading and precedence are now strictly defined by the order of sources passed to the `configuration(...)` builder, followed by its `overrides` parameter, and finally `Annotated[..., Value(...)]` (ADR-010).

### Removed ‚ùå

* **`@configuration` Decorator**: This decorator, previously used for flat key-value binding, has been completely removed in favor of the unified `@configured` decorator (ADR-010).
* Separate `config` (flat) and `tree_config` arguments in `init()`.

### Documentation üìö

* Updated all documentation (User Guide, API Reference, Examples, ADRs) to reflect the unified configuration system based on `@configured`, `configuration(...)`, and `ContextConfig`.
* Added `docs/specs/spec-configuration.md` detailing the unified configuration rules.
* Added migration notes related to removing `@configuration`.

### Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

* This release introduces **significant breaking changes** related to configuration management, requiring migration from the old `@configuration` decorator and `init()` arguments to the new `@configured` modes and `configuration(...)` builder (ADR-010).

## [2.0.3] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed

- Injection now falls back from an annotated key to the parameter name when the annotated key is unbound, enabling resolution against string-key providers registered via `@provides("name")`.
- `ProviderNotFoundError` includes the requesting origin (component or key) to aid debugging and test assertions.
- Unified sync/async resolution path in `PicoContainer`:
  - `get()` raises `AsyncResolutionError` if a provider returns an awaitable, guiding users to `aget()`.
  - `aget()` awaits awaitables and applies aspects and caching consistently.
  - Observers receive accurate resolve timings in both paths.

### Added

- `AsyncResolutionError` to signal misuse of `get()` when a provider is async.
- More informative tracer notes for parameter binding.

### Internal

- `ComponentFactory.get()` now accepts an `origin` to enrich `ProviderNotFoundError` messages.
- Lazy proxy creation calls `factory.get(key, origin="lazy")` to attribute provenance.
- Public API exports updated to include `AsyncResolutionError`.

### Compatibility

- No public API breaking changes. Internal factory signature changed but remains encapsulated within the container/registrar.

## [2.0.2] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed üß©

* **`@provides` Decorator Execution**
  Corrected an issue where the `@provides` decorator executed its wrapped function prematurely during module import, leading to runtime errors like `TypeError: Service() takes no arguments`.
  The decorator now properly registers provider metadata without invoking the function until dependency resolution time.

### Added ‚ú®

* **`FlatDictSource` Configuration Provider**
  Introduced a lightweight configuration source for flat in-memory dictionaries.
  Supports optional key prefixing and case sensitivity control for simple, programmatic configuration injection.

### Internal üîß

* Updated type imports and registration logic in `api.py` to support `Mapping` for the new configuration source.
* Added `FlatDictSource` to the public API (`__all__` and import namespace).

### Notes üìù

* Fully backward compatible.
* This patch release focuses on decorator correctness and configuration flexibility improvements.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-25

### Added ‚ú®

- **ADR-0009: Flexible `@provides` Support**  
  Implemented support for using `@provides` in additional contexts:
  - `@staticmethod` methods within `@factory` classes  
  - `@classmethod` methods within `@factory` classes  
  - Module-level functions  
  These new provider types are discovered automatically during module scanning and participate fully in dependency resolution, validation, and graph generation.

- **Dependency Graph and Validation Enhancements**  
  - `_build_resolution_graph` now includes edges for all `@provides` functions, regardless of where they are defined.  
  - Fail-fast validation checks now cover static/class/module-level providers, reporting missing bindings consistently.  
  - Scope inference and promotion logic apply equally to these new provider types.

### Documentation üìö

- Expanded `docs/overview.md` to document the new flexible provider options (`@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, module-level functions).  
- Updated `docs/guide.md` with practical examples showing when to use each style of provider.  
- Linked ADR-0009 for design rationale and migration guidance.

### Notes üìù

- This is a **minor feature release** introducing a major ergonomics improvement (ADR-0009).  
- Fully backward compatible with existing factories, components, and configuration mechanisms.  
- Encourages a lighter, more Pythonic style for simple provider declarations.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-23

This version marks a significant redesign and the first major public release, establishing the core architecture and feature set based on the principles outlined in the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

### üöÄ Highlights

* **Async-Native Core:** Introduced first-class `async`/`await` support across component resolution (`container.aget`), initialization (`__ainit__`), lifecycle hooks (`@configure`, `@cleanup`), AOP interceptors, and the event bus (ADR-001).
* **Tree-Based Configuration:** Added `@configured` decorator and `TreeSource` protocol for binding complex, nested configuration (YAML/JSON) to dataclass graphs, including interpolation and type coercion (ADR-002).
* **Context-Aware Scopes:** Implemented `contextvars`-based scopes (e.g., `"request"`, `"session"`) for managing component lifecycles tied to specific contexts (ADR-003).
* **Observability Features:** Integrated container context (`container_id`, `as_current`), basic stats (`container.stats()`), observer protocol (`ContainerObserver`), and dependency graph export (`container.export_graph()`) (ADR-004).
* **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Implemented method interception via `MethodInterceptor` protocol and `@intercepted_by` decorator, using a dynamic proxy (`UnifiedComponentProxy`) (ADR-005).
* **Eager Startup Validation:** Added fail-fast validation during `init()` to detect missing dependencies and configuration errors before runtime (ADR-006).
* **Built-in Event Bus:** Included an asynchronous, in-process event bus (`EventBus`, `@subscribe`, `AutoSubscriberMixin`) for decoupled communication (ADR-007).
* **Explicit Circular Dependency Handling:** Implemented detection and fail-fast for circular dependencies, requiring explicit resolution patterns (ADR-008).
* **Unified Decorator API:** Consolidated component metadata into parameterized decorators (`@component`, `@factory`, `@provides`), removing older stacked decorators (ADR-009).

### ‚ú® Added

* Conditional binding parameters (`conditional_profiles`, `conditional_require_env`, `conditional_predicate`).
* Fallback binding parameters (`on_missing_selector`, `on_missing_priority`).
* Primary selection parameter (`primary=True`).
* Testing support via `init(overrides={...})` and `init(profiles=(...))`.
* Container context management (`as_current`, `get_current`, `shutdown`, `all_containers`).
