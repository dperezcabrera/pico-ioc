# Exporting the Dependency Graph üìà

Understanding the full dependency graph of your application can be crucial for debugging, refactoring, and verifying the architecture. `pico-ioc` provides a utility to export a representation of the dependency graph of an initialized container in the **Graphviz DOT format**.

---

## How it Works

The `container.export_graph()` method generates the content for a `.dot` file. This file describes the graph structure (nodes representing components, edges representing dependencies). You can then use the **Graphviz tool** (which needs to be installed separately) to render this `.dot` file into various visual formats (like PNG, SVG, PDF).

### Prerequisites

To render the generated `.dot` file into an image, you need the **Graphviz command-line tool** installed on your system.
* **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install graphviz`
* **Linux (apt):** `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install graphviz`
* **Windows:** Download from [graphviz.org](https://graphviz.org/download/) and ensure the `dot` command is added to your system's PATH.

---

## Basic Usage

You call `export_graph()` on an initialized container instance, specifying the path where you want to save the `.dot` file.

```python
# my_app.py
from pico_ioc import component, init
# Assuming DependencyResolverError is not the standard error,
# InvalidBindingError or ComponentCreationError might be more relevant
# from pico_ioc import InvalidBindingError

@component
class ConfigService:
    def get_setting(self) -> str:
        return "some_value"

@component
class AuthService:
    def __init__(self, config: ConfigService):
        self.config = config

@component
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, auth: AuthService, config: ConfigService):
        self.auth = auth
        self.config = config

@component
class AppRunner:
    def __init__(self, user_service: UserService):
        self.user_service = user_service

# Initialize the container
container = init(modules=[__name__])

# Export the graph definition to a .dot file
dot_file_path = "./dependency_graph.dot"
container.export_graph(path=dot_file_path, title="My Application Graph")

print(f"Dependency graph definition exported to {dot_file_path}")
print(f"To render as PNG, run: dot -Tpng {dot_file_path} -o dependency_graph.png")

# --- Example: How to render using the 'dot' command ---
# Open your terminal and run:
# dot -Tpng dependency_graph.dot -o dependency_graph.png
# Or for SVG:
# dot -Tsvg dependency_graph.dot -o dependency_graph.svg
```

When you run `my_app.py`, a file named `dependency_graph.dot` will be generated. You then use the `dot` command-line tool to create the visual image (e.g., `dependency_graph.png`).

### `export_graph` Parameters

  * **`path: str`**: The full path (including filename, typically ending in `.dot`) where the Graphviz definition file will be saved.
  * **`include_scopes: bool = True`**: If `True`, adds scope information (e.g., `[scope=request]`) to the node labels in the `.dot` file.
  * **`include_qualifiers: bool = False`**: If `True`, adds qualifier information (e.g., `\\n‚ü®q‚ü©`) to the node labels in the `.dot` file.
  * **`rankdir: str = "LR"`**: Sets the layout direction hint for Graphviz (e.g., `"LR"` for Left-to-Right, `"TB"` for Top-to-Bottom) in the `.dot` file.
  * **`title: Optional[str] = None`**: An optional title string to include in the graph definition.

-----

## Example of a Rendered Graph

Rendering the generated `.dot` file (e.g., with `dot -Tpng dependency_graph.dot -o graph.png`) might produce an image like this for a simple dependency structure:

**Node Labels (controlled by parameters):**

  * **Component Name:** Always shown (e.g., `UserService`).
  * **Scope:** Added if `include_scopes=True` (e.g., `UserService\n[scope=singleton]`).
  * **Qualifiers:** Added if `include_qualifiers=True` and qualifiers exist (e.g., `MyService\n‚ü®payment‚ü©`).

-----

## Visualizing Potential Issues

While the current implementation focuses on exporting the graph of *successfully resolved* bindings during `init`, you can use the visual graph to:

  * Identify overly complex dependency chains.
  * Spot components with too many responsibilities (many outgoing arrows).
  * Verify that components are assigned the expected scopes.
  * Visually trace how dependencies flow through your application.

*(Note: The `include_unresolved` feature mentioned in older documentation is not present in the current code implementation provided.)*
