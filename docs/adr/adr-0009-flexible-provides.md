# ADR-0009: Flexible `@provides` for Module-level and Static Methods

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

In many DI frameworks, providers (methods that create components) are required to be *instance methods* on a dedicated factory class.

```python
# The "heavy" factory pattern
@factory
class ServiceFactory:
    def __init__(self, db: Database):
        self.db = db # Factory instance holds state

    @provides(Service)
    def build_service(self) -> Service:
        return Service(self.db) # Uses 'self'
```

While this pattern is powerful for providers that need shared state or configuration (from the factory's `__init__`), it creates unnecessary boilerplate for two common use cases:

1.  **Stateless Providers:** If a provider method doesn't depend on `self`, forcing the container to instantiate the factory class first is inefficient or unnecessary.
2.  **Simple Providers:** If a module only needs to provide one or two simple components, creating an entire `@factory` class just to host the `@provides` methods is verbose and adds a layer of indirection.

We needed a lighter-weight, more "Pythonic" way to declare simple providers.

## Decision

We decided to make the `@provides` decorator flexible, allowing it to be used in two additional contexts beyond just factory instance methods:

1.  **On regular, module-level functions:** The container discovers these functions during module scanning and treats them as direct providers. Dependencies are injected based on the function signature. This is the preferred method for simple, standalone providers.
2.  **On `@staticmethod` methods within a `@factory` class:** The container treats this as a provider function and injects its dependencies from its signature. *Note: The current registration logic might instantiate the factory class unnecessarily even for static methods, though functionally it works.*

\**(Support for `@classmethod` was not explicitly addressed in the registration logic and its behavior is currently considered undefined or potentially inefficient).*

### Example 1: Module-level function (Preferred for Simplicity)

This is the simplest pattern for a single provider.

```python
# services.py

@component
class Database: ...

# No factory class needed
@provides(Service)
def build_service(db: Database) -> Service:
    # Dependencies (Database) are injected directly
    return Service(db)
```

### Example 2: `staticmethod` (For Grouping Stateless Providers)

This is useful for grouping related, stateless providers in a `@factory` class namespace.

```python
@factory
class ClientFactory:
    @staticmethod
    @provides(S3Client)
    def build_s3(config: S3Config) -> S3Client:
        # Dependencies (S3Config) are injected into the static method
        return S3Client.from_config(config)

    @staticmethod
    @provides(RedisClient)
    def build_redis(config: RedisConfig) -> RedisClient:
        return RedisClient.from_url(config.url)
```

## Consequences

**Positive:** üëç

  * **Significantly Reduces Boilerplate:** Eliminates the need for a `@factory` class for simple cases (module-level functions).
  * **Improves Ergonomics:** Feels more natural to Python developers who are used to module-level helper functions.
  * **Clearer Code Structure:** Allows simple providers to live at the module level, while complex, stateful providers remain encapsulated in factory instances. Grouping stateless providers via `staticmethod` is possible.

**Negative:** üëé

  * **Multiple Patterns:** Introduces multiple ways to register a provider (instance method, static method, module function). Requires clear documentation (`user-guide/core-concepts.md`) to guide users.
  * **Implementation Nuance:** The current implementation's handling of `staticmethod` registration within `@factory` classes is functional but less efficient than ideal (involves unnecessary factory instantiation). Support for `@classmethod` is currently undefined by the registration logic.
